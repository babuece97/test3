              A startup or start up is a company initiated by individual
              founders or entrepreneurs to search for a repeatable and scalable
              business model. Founders design startups to effectively develop
              and validate a scalable business model.[1][2] Hence, the concepts
              of startups and entrepreneurship are similar. However,
              entrepreneurship refers all new businesses, including
              self-employment and businesses that never intend to grow big or
              become registered, while startups refer to new businesses that
              intend to grow beyond the solo founder, have employees, and intend
              to grow large.[citation needed] Start ups face high uncertainty[3]
              and do have high rates of failure, but the minority that go on to
              be successful companies have the potential to become large and
              influential.[4] Some startups become unicorns, i.e. privately held
              startup companies valued at over $1 billion.

              Startups typically begin by a founder (solo-founder) or
              co-founders who have a way to solve a problem. The founder(s) of a
              startup will begin market validation by problem interview,
              solution interview, and building a minimum viable product (MVP),
              i.e. a prototype, to develop and validate their business models.
              The startup process can take a long period of time (by some
              estimates, three years or longer), and hence sustaining effort is
              required. Sustaining effort over the long term is especially
              challenging because of the high failure rates and uncertain
              outcomes.[5].

                Models behind startups presenting as ventures are usually
                associated with design science. Design science uses design
                principles considered to be a coherent set of normative ideas
                and propositions to design and construct the company
                backbone.[6] For example, one of the initial design principles
                in effectuation is "affordable loss".[7].

                In startups, many decisions are made under uncertainty[3], and
                hence a key principle for startups is to be agile and flexible.
                Founders can embed options to design startups in flexible
                manners, so that the startups can change easily in future.
                Uncertainty can vary within-person.

                Startups may form partnerships with other firms to enable their
                business model to operate.[12] To become attractive to other
                businesses, startups need to align their internal features, such
                as management style and products with the market situation. This
                profile is set out to be more successful (in finding a business
                partner) in a market that does not have a dominant design
                (established standard).
